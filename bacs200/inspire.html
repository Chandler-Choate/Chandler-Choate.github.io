	<p>Jealousy and curiosity of our neighbors is not a new phenomenon, Marie Curie once said “Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas”. Having grown up in the late 1800’s, Marie Curie was ahead of her time in more ways than one. Not only did she make astonishing discoveries without a fancy lab, but she was the first female to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. In order to accomplish this, she first had to leave her homeland of Poland and head to France, where higher education for women was permitted.

	The ability to see into other people’s lives and to want what they have, has become the forefront of our society. People spend on average two and a half hours on various social media sites, this time is spent looking at the perceived lives of others, instead of furthering our own knowledge by learning new ideas. Marie Curie was able to see that envying others would not benefit herself, and would in turn set her back. This ability allowed her to excel in areas of science when others had yet to do so.

	If we could all be a little more like Marie Curie, then we would be able to enjoy seeing other people's accomplishments and successes without being envious. This will then help to inspire ourselves to accomplish our own goals.
