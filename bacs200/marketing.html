				<p>Are you looking to adopt a furry friend? Well look no farther than Big Bones Canine Rescue! It brings us joy getting to help find you the perfect dog that will fit right in with your family.</p> 
				<p>When choosing a dog it is important to remember that you are everything to them, and they were placed on this Earth to bring happiness to anyone that comes in contact with them. No matter the stage of a dog's life, Big Bones Canine Rescue is here to help each dog find their forever family.</p>
			<h2>Forever Homes</h2>
				<p>As a no kill shelter, Big Bones Canine strives to provide the best care for our dogs until they can find their forever families. What is a forever home? A forever home is just as it sounds, it's a family that will unconditionally love their dog, just as their dog will do for them.</p>
				<p>Being a forever family takes commitment, in the fun times and the not so fun, like bath time. Meaning you should make sure you are prepared, before applying to adopt. Once you are ready we know we can help you find the perfect companion to complete your family.</p>
			<h2>Stay in Touch</h2>
				<p>Once you adopt your furry friend, we want you to continuously show us how you spoil them. Whether you are taking them to the park, on a cross country road trip, or simply to get a pup cup from their favorite coffee shop, make sure to show us. Tag us on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter and use our hashtag, #bigbonescaninerescue, so we can join in on the fun!</p>
				<p>Remember adopting a dog won't only change their life for the better, but yours as well. For a dog, you are their whole world.</p>
