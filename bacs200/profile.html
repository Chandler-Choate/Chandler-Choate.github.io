		<p>
		Hi, My name is Chandler Choate!
		</p>
		<p>
		I will be graduating from the University of Northern Colorado in spring of 2022, with a General Business Degree and a Digital Marketing Certificate. I believe that digital marketing is the marketing of the future, and as it is an ever-changing industry there is always something to learn.

		<h2>Special Interests</h2>
		<p>In my spare time I like to keep busy. Here are some of the activities I enjoy:<p>
		<ul>
		<li>In a different life I like to believe I was a baker. Each week I try to bake something new or improve old recipes to make them better. Lately, I have found myself making a variety of cookies. Here are some of my favorites that I hope you try out too!</li>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://pin.it/4hyXC65">5-Ingredient Raspberry Cheesecake Thumbprint Cookies</a><li>
				<li><a href="https://pin.it/5LzaDma">Chocolate Chip Pudding Cookies</a><li>
				<li><a href="https://pin.it/Z8yITTp">Salted Pretzel Cowboy Party Cookies</a><li>
			</ul>
		<li>A new hobby that I have recently developed is running. I started running about in 2019 with the sole purpose to keep my husky, Kenney, active and fit. Little did I know that I would soon come to love it, and now not only do I run for Kenney, but also for myself.</li>
		<li>Being able to escape into another world and become part of it, is why I love to read. When I find a book that grabs my attention from the first page, I have trouble putting it down, and find myself consumed with it. I find myself leaning towards mystery or crime novels, as to me they are so enticing. If you are looking for some good reads here are some of my recommendations:</li>
