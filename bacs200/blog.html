					<h3>What is cryptocurrency?</h3>
						<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital form of currency with each transaction being monitored by a software called cryptography or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/explaining-crypto-cryptocurrency/#:~:text=%22Cryptography%22%20means%20%22secret%20writing,ensure%20pseudo%2D%20or%20full%20anonymity.">“secret writing".</a> This software allows for secure transactions that only the sender and receiver can access, and verifies that the transaction was complete; instead of the traditional banking system. These transactions are then recorded into a public list, called blockchains.</p>
						<p>This new form of currency can affect our society, socially, economically, and politically.</p>

				<h2>Social Implicaitons</h2>
						<p>Since cryptocurrency is a form of online currency, and the same throughout each country, it has allowed for social benefits as well as drawbacks. One major benefit is that it allows consumers to transfer funds from one country to another, quickly and without the use of banks</p>
						<p>For example, in the event of an emergency or simply sending money to a family member overseas, the currency is immediately deposited into their virtual wallet allowing them to use the money instantaneously. Instead of the traditional waiting period that banks and other sites have.</p>

			<section class="implication" id="imp-economical">
				<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
						<p>Similar to how cryptocurrency affects us socially, we can experience the same benefits economically. One struggle business can face is how to perform overseas. The use of cyprtocurrey has made it easier to conduct business in a different country than just the one you are located in, and according to <a href="https://theconversation.com/cryptocurrency-has-an-impact-on-economies-thats-why-some-are-afraid-of-it-and-some-welcome-it-175911"> The Conversation</a>, some countries have faced electricity shortages and are therefore forced to ration power leaving currency miners at a loss. Meaning no one has access to their money during these power outages.</p>
						<p>With the system of bypassing banks, this has allowed for residents of developing countries to place their income into a more stable currency. However, this alone can cause problems due to cryptocurrencies fluctuation in value, causing some people to feel uneasy when it comes to transferring their money, because of the uncertainty that follows.</p>

			<section class="implication" id="imp-political">
				<h2>Political Implications</h2>
						<p>Some governments are cautious about cryptocurrency as it could uproot the current financial system. As previously stated cryptocurrency is not backed by a bank, this means that the government loses their role in controlling the system, making them favor traditional currency methods.</p>
						<p>Another reason government officials like to keep cryptocurrency off the market is due to the fact that it can be associated with criminal activity. Since this currency has no regulations users can spend their money however they choose, even on the dark web.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="Conclusion">
				<h2>Take Away</h2>
						<p>Cryptocurrency has been here since the early 2000’s, and is not expected to lose popularity in the coming years. While government officials may be wary of its use, it can help us socially and politically by allowing for a unique currency system.</p>
