		<p>Here are some things that bring me joy, that I would like to share with you!</p>
		<h2>Amusement #1 - Kenney's Instagram</h2>
		<p>One of my favorite things is my husky Kenney. His Instagram is operated by myself, with the main goal being to bring joy to anyone who may see it.</p>

		<h2>Amusement #2 - Shop the Blog</h2>
		<p>Shop the Blog, is a blog that is run by one of my favorite Influencers, Jennifer Todryk or <a href="https://instagram.com/theramblingredhead?utm_medium=copy_link">@theramblingredhead</a>. The purpose of her blog is to give easy access to all the things she has purchased and shared on her Instagram account.</p>
		<p>The reason I enjoy this blog is due to the fact that it gives me direct links to things she has purchased on various sites such as Amazon or clothing stores. I trust her opinion and enjoy seeing the different things she is sharing.</p>
